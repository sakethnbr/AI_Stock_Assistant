PROBLEMS WITH THE CODE RIGHT NOW:

1.We are still getting segmentation faults for some reason, it has to do with the import
statement and importing the yfinance and pandas libraries


SEQUENCE OF PROJECT:
1. Authenticate with the Open AI API key
2. Define and create all of the functions that we want to use
3. Define these functions that exist by creating a list of dictionaries
4. Map the function names to the actual functions 
5. Create streamlit web application calls process to pass information in to and from the Open AI API
6. Take in the inputs and identify what functions to call and pass in the arguments
7. Take outputs produced by functions and run them through OpenAI API and bring back responses


REMAINING STEPS FOR COMPLETION:
1. Fix import statement issues
2. Run couple tests
3. Publish to gitHub and add on resume
